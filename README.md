** Overview of project
  The purpose of the project was to analysis DQ stock performance and then analyze all stocks for years 2017 and 2018. The analysis created a sheet with the analysis of just the DQ stock. The file also includes a worksheet with a macro that created a button to click and choose the year to show the analysis of all stocks (2017 or 2018).
  
  ** Results
    The analysis provided a clean and user friendly way to present the stock analysis.
    
 ** In general, refactoring code uses less computer memory, runs quicker and presents the code in a cleaner and easier to use code.
    For this stock analysis the refactoring provided a faster run time when clicking the "All Stocks Analysis" button. It also uses less computer memory. The run times are as follows:
    ORIGINQL: 2017 0.09375
              2018 0.06640625

Refactored: 2017 0.06640625
            2018 0.0625
